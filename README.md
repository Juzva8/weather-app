# weather-app


## Description 

This site allows the user to input a city and spit out two different data sets (one for the current weather status and one for the 5 day forecast). The site was also to save their search results to the local storage so that when they reload the page it saves their pre-searched cities. I had to use three because the current weather, 5-day forecast and UV index all utilize separate APIs (links below). One poorly optimized facet of the pulling of the UV index. Because it requires the latitude and longitude of the city to run, it required and AJAX call inside of another AJAX call.
